# JS-3D-Object-Graphic-Pipeline

About
A javascript coded program that displays a 3D object (.obj file) in your web browser using HTML canvas. 
With keyboard controls, it allows you to translate, scale, and rotate the object in a desired way. 
The default configuration correctly displays objects that fit a cube sized 1x1x1, but can be changed to view differently 
sized objects as well.

Instructions
1. Put the .html and .js pipeline files in the same folder.
2. Open the .html file using a web browser and choose the 3D object you want to open.
3. Translate the object using arrow keys and '9', '0'.
4. Scale the object along x, y, z axis using number keys ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6').
5. Rotate the object using numpad keys ('1' and '3' in z axis, '4' and '6' in y axis, and '2' and '8' in x axis).
